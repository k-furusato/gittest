	Stay close		寄り添いながら
Move fast		足取りは速く
The darkness cannot last		暗闇だっていつか晴れる
No hope		希望は無く
No path		行き先も分からない
But we've got a dream to catch		でも私達には掴むべき夢がある
And we cannot wait		もう待ってはいられない
Trust the way we're made		授けられた生き方を信じるんだ
The sparrow's born to fly		スズメは飛び立つために生まれ
The mountains tower		山々は高くそびえ
The river knows to reach the sea		川は海へ至ることを知っている
Rain will help the flowers be		雨はあの花達の助けになる
We're the same, you and me		私達も同じ　そう 貴方も私も
The lightning doesn't take advice from anyone		稲妻は助言を聞いたりしないし
The willow doesn't need to learn to stand		ヤナギは立ち方を自分で知っている
As sun seeks day		太陽が昼を追っていくように
We'll find our way		私達も道を見つけてみせる
And we'll catch the dream together		一緒に夢を掴んでみせる
Someday soon		そう遠くない日に
We're rising like the moon		月のように昇っていくんだ
Stand firm, outlast		
We won't be beaten by the past		
One goal, one pact		
Looking forward, never back		
And we're on our way		
Love's the choice we made		
We're looking to the sky		
The light will guide us		
The rose will grow to be a seed		
From every life, another leads		
Born the way we're meant to be		
The sky is turning black		
The light is fading fast		
But we don't surrender		
Shattering the night		
Radiant and bright		
Armored in splendor		
Shining forever		
We are paragons of virtue and glory		
Death can't bind our endless story		
Infinite		
And unbound		
The lightning doesn't take advice from anyone		
The willow doesn't need to learn to stand		
As sun seeks day		
We'll find our way		
And we'll catch the dream together		
Someday soon		
We're rising like the moon
