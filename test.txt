3rd challenge all change
Stay close
Move fast
The darkness cannot last
No hope
No path
But we've got a dream to catch!

And we cannot wait
Trust the way we're made
The sparrow's born to fly
The mountains tower
The river knows to reach the sea
Rain will help the flowers be
We're the same, you and me

The lightning doesn't take advice from anyone
The willow doesn't need to learn to stand
As sun seeks day
We'll find our way
And we'll catch that dream together someday soon
We're rising like the moon[1]

Stand firm
Outlast
We won't be beaten by the past
One goal
One pact
Looking forward, never back

And we're on our way
Love's the choice we've made
We're looking to the sky
The light will guide us
The rose will grow to be a seed
From every life, another leads
Born the way we're meant to be

The sky is turning black
Light is fading fast
But we don't surrender
Shattering the night
Radiant and bright
Armored in splendor
Shining forever

We are paragons of virtue and glory
Death can't bind our endless story
Infinite and unbound

The lightning doesn't take advice from anyone
The willow doesn't need to learn to stand
As sun seeks day
We'll find our way
And we'll catch that dream together someday soon
We're rising like the moon[2]
